## About this repo?

This is a demo app to show how you can integrate Dialogue Wise into your .Net applications.



## Integrating the API into your apps

You could call the Dialogue Wise Api just like any other api. Integrating the API, install the below `Nuget` package.

Install-Package DialogueWise -Version 1.0.0
```

Please refer to [Program.cs](https://github.com/dialoguewise/dialoguewise-demo-dotnet/blob/master/Program.cs) in the git repo which demonstrates usage of this Nuget and the example mentioned above.
